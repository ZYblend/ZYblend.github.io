### Brief Intro
I am a research assistant working with [Dr.Olugbenga Moses Anubi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4AGpwF0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [Center for Adanced Power Systems](https://www.caps.fsu.edu), Florida State university. I am working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering. My research interest is on Attack-Resilient Control and Estimation for Cyber-Physical Systems (and autonomous sytem), and now he is putting his force on the L1 norm-based Dynamic Observer design against False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs).
